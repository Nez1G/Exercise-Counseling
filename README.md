# Exercise-Counseling
A program made in prolog that, using the data that a user inserts, helps him find exercises for him to practice.
It takes into account some variables to find the best exercises for each individual user, such as, weight, height, IMC,
physical or other kind of problems, age, personal budget and the type of objective that the user have in mind and it could be loose weight,
gain mass, well being or personal interest.

For example if the user have joint problems it will advise the user that he should not make some type of exercises because of 
him/her problem, etc.

The inference system used was the forwad system.
